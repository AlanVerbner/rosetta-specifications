## Overview
The Rosetta API is specified in the [OpenAPI 3.0 format](https://www.openapis.org)
(the [successor to Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0](https://swagger.io/blog/news/whats-new-in-openapi-3-0)).
Requests and responses can be crafted with autogenerated code using
[Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen) or
[OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) (with
the downloadable JSON spec at the top of this site),
are human-readable (easy to debug and understand), and can be used in servers and browsers.

## Documentation
Before diving into the specifications and starting your implementation, we recommend taking a look at the Rosetta API Docs:

* [Overview](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/welcome.html)
* [Node API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/node_api_introduction.html)
* [Wallet API (coming soon!)](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/wallet_api_introduction.html)

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out in our [community forum](https://community.rosetta-api.org).

## Writing a Node API Implementation

### Use Golang
If you are comfortable with Golang, the easiest way to write a Rosetta API implementation
is to use [rosetta-sdk-go](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go).

[example](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go/tree/master/examples/server).

### Use Another Language
To use any other language, we recommend generating basic types and a server framework
using

## Validating Your Implementation
To validate your implementation, check out the [rosetta-cli](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-cli).

## Writing an Integration
To write an integration with a Rosetta API implementation, we recommend using [rosetta-sdk-go](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go). There
are examples using 2 different packages and a ton of examples in the [rosetta-cli](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-cli).

Take a look at the [blog](https://www.rosetta-api.org/blog/2020/06/17/1-try-celo-rosetta.html) explaining how
to fetch blocks from Celo.

### Syncing Package
In particular, integrators will likely be interested in the `syncer` package that can be found in the `rosett-sdk-go`.

## SDKs in More Languages
We've spent a lot of time polishing and building on top of [rosetta-sdk-go](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go). At Coinbase, we write
most of our code in Golang so this was the natural choice for us to invest our time and resources. We'd love to see implementations
in Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript as many new blockchains use Rust and many developers rely on JavaScript/TypeScript.

If you write an implementation of an SDK in another language, please reach out on the [Ecosystem](https://community.rosetta-api.org/c/ecosystem).

## Specification Development
* `make deps` to install dependencies
* `make gen` to generate the specification files
* `make validate` to ensure specification is valid
* `make release` to check if code passes all tests run by CircleCI
