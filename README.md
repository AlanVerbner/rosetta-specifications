## Overview
The Rosetta API is specified in the [OpenAPI 3.0 format](https://www.openapis.org)
(the [successor to Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0](https://swagger.io/blog/news/whats-new-in-openapi-3-0)).
Requests and responses can be crafted with auto-generated code using
[Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen) or
[OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech), are human-readable
(easy to debug and understand), and can be used in servers and browsers.

## Documentation
Before diving into the specifications and starting your implementation, we recommend taking a look at the Rosetta API Docs:

* [Overview](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/welcome.html)
* [Node API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/node_api_introduction.html)
* [Wallet API (coming soon!)](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/wallet_api_introduction.html)

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out in our [community forum](https://community.rosetta-api.org).

## Writing a Node API Implementation
If you've made it this far, you are interested in developing a Rosetta Node API implementation
for a blockchain project you are working on. As mentioned in the Rosetta doumentation, there
is [no restriction on what language you choose to use for your implementation](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/no_gatekeepers.html#no-required-languages)
and [no repository](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/no_gatekeepers.html#no-master-repository)
where you must open a PR to share your work.

When you've finished an implementation for a blockchain (make sure you
[meet the expectations of any "complete" implementation](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/node_deployment.html)),
share your work in the [ecosystem category of the community site](https://community.rosetta-api.org/c/ecosystem).
Platforms looking for implementations for certain blockchains will be monitoring
this section of the website for high-quality implementations they can use
for integration.

### Using Golang
If you are comfortable with Golang, the easiest way to write a Rosetta Node API implementation
is to use the [rosetta-sdk-go](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go). This Golang project
provides a [server](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go/tree/master/server) package that
allows a developer to write a Rosetta Node API server by implementing an interface. It automatically
ensures client requests are valid and routes requests to the functions you've implemented in
Go types (instead of in raw JSON).

There is a simple [example](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go/tree/master/examples/server) of
how to write an implementation using this package in [rosetta-sdk-go](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go).

### Using Another Language
To use any other language, we recommend generating basic types and a server framework
using

## Validating Your Implementation
To validate your implementation, check out the [rosetta-cli](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-cli).

## Writing an Integration
To write an integration with a Rosetta API implementation, we recommend using [rosetta-sdk-go](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go). There
are examples using 2 different packages and a ton of examples in the [rosetta-cli](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-cli).

Take a look at the [blog](https://www.rosetta-api.org/blog/2020/06/17/1-try-celo-rosetta.html) explaining how
to fetch blocks from Celo.

### Syncing Package
In particular, integrators will likely be interested in the `syncer` package that can be found in the `rosett-sdk-go`.

## SDKs in More Languages
We've spent a lot of time polishing and building on top of [rosetta-sdk-go](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go). At Coinbase, we write
most of our code in Golang so this was the natural choice for us to invest our time and resources. We'd love to see implementations
in Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript as many new blockchains use Rust and many developers rely on JavaScript/TypeScript.

If you write an implementation of an SDK in another language, please reach out on the [Ecosystem](https://community.rosetta-api.org/c/ecosystem).

## Specification Development
* `make deps` to install dependencies
* `make gen` to generate the specification files
* `make validate` to ensure specification is valid
* `make release` to check if code passes all tests run by CircleCI
